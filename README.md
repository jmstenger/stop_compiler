# Stop Programming Language

This repo is based off a project I worked on as part of the COMS 4115: Programming Languages & Translators course taught by Professor Stephen A. Edwards at Columbia University. The aim of the project was to design and implement a functional, object-oriented language which compiled to the LLVM Intermediate Representation (LLVM IR). In implementing the compiler my team and I utilized a variety of tools including Ocamllex, Ocamlyacc, the LLVM Ocaml API, and the Jane Street Core Ocaml Libraries.

## Setup Instructions:

### Installation under Ubuntu 16.04

The first step is to get Ocaml & OPAM installed. OPAM is a package manager for OCaml which we need in order to install external libraries like Core and the LLVM Ocaml bindings. Detailed instructions are available at:
	https://github.com/realworldocaml/book/wiki/Installation-Instructions


When I installed the project, the process was:

	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:avsm/ppa
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install curl build-essential m4 ocaml opam	
	
	opam init
	opam switch
	eval `opam config env`
	opam install core utop

(Note that you may need to add "eval `opam config env` to your ~/.bashrc)

Having installed OCaml & OPAM, you now need to add dependencies specific to the project:

Install llvm using apt-get. During installation take note of which version of llvm is being installed and then install the appropriate bindings in opam. When I installed the project, apt-get installed llvm 3.8, so I installed the llvm 3.8 bindings in opam:

	sudo apt-get install llvm
	opam install llvm.3.8
